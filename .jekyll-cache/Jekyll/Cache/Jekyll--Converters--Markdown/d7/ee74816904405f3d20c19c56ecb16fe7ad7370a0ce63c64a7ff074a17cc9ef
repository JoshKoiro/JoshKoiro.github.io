I"«<p>There‚Äôs something so invigorating about looking at the screen; intently eying the terminal, the web page, or the application and seeing the phrase <em>‚ÄúHello World!</em> staring back at you.</p>

<p>The rush of excitement you feel if you are a fellow nerd like me, comes from the knowledge that you have made the first dive into discovering something new: A new framework, a new language. The simple phrase <em>‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù</em> confirms that you are the digital equivalent of an artist in front of a blank page successfully making his first stroke, or a musician making the first clear note on his instrument.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It‚Äôs beautiful.</p>

<p>While their is no problem-solving purpose for creating a program that does nothing but say hello to the world, I believe it is symbolic of a new beginning, and new ability for creation.</p>

<p>This first blog post for me is a kind of hello world. I‚Äôve been wanting to write for some time, sharing thoughts ideas and discoveries with the world in an effort to spread not only my own knowledge, but also to perhaps open new opportunities to grow. Attempting to teach someone something you are learning has been proven to be one of the best most efficient and thorough methods to learn.</p>

<p>So while I hope that you as the reader may be able to get something good out of my postings, and perhaps be able to share in my excitement about learning new things, my goal in writing is more self-seeking in the fact that hopefully it will help me to learn more thoroughly and continue to refine my skills as a teacher as well as a learner.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not to say that I don‚Äôt want you to read. I will certainly try to make content that will be worth reading! I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>While the content of this blog will be diverse and may flex and change with my current projects and interests, I have sought to narrow the scope of this down to several categories listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Productivity</li>
  <li>Creativity</li>
  <li>Organization</li>
  <li>Music</li>
  <li>Philosophy</li>
  <li>Psychology</li>
  <li>Art</li>
  <li>Coding</li>
  <li>Spirituality</li>
  <li>Relationships</li>
  <li>Biblical Theology</li>
</ul>

<p>While this may seem like a random assortment of very diverse topics (and it is!) I believe there are common threads that lie throughout these topics along with many others. One of the driving forces for cultivating a lifestyle of life-long learning is discovering connections between diverse ideas that illuminate new understanding of how to approach these ideas. The practice of making music may have a benefit on mental health, what you understand about spirituality and God may have an impact on how you organize your daily work flow and productivity. Philosophy may hold an insight into better coding practices.</p>

<p>Every once and a while I will come across an insight like this. Doesn‚Äôt happen very often, but when it does it pushes me to continue learning. I hope this blog helps you to get excited about learning and understanding complex things. You are an amazing and wonderful human being that can accomplish and create much more then you realize!</p>

<p>Long live nerd-dom!</p>
